# youtube-sentiment

Got it 👍 — I’ll keep it **professional, clean, and readable** while still slightly eye-catching.
I’ll reduce emojis to just a few section markers, so it feels balanced.

Here’s the refined **README.md**:

# YouTube Sentiment Analysis 🎬

This project performs **sentiment analysis on YouTube comments**, covering the complete ML pipeline:
**data ingestion → preprocessing → exploratory analysis → model training → evaluation**.
The final model uses **LightGBM**, and the workflow is version-controlled with **DVC**.

---

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Ingestion

* Collect YouTube comments data
* Store in structured format for reproducibility

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* Clean text (remove stopwords, punctuation, emojis, etc.)
* Tokenization & vectorization (TF-IDF / embeddings)
* Handle missing values

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Visualize sentiment distribution
* Generate word clouds for positive/negative words
* Correlation & feature importance plots

### 4. Model Training

* Trained multiple tree-based algorithms (Random Forest, GBM, etc.)
* **LightGBM chosen as the final model** for best accuracy & efficiency

### 5. Experiment Tracking & Versioning

* **DVC** tracks datasets, experiments & results
* Pipeline stages defined in `dvc.yaml`

---

## Tech Stack

* Python 3.x
* Pandas, NumPy – data handling
* Scikit-learn – preprocessing & baselines
* LightGBM – final ML model
* Matplotlib, Seaborn – visualization
* DVC – experiment tracking & reproducibility

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/youtube-sentiment.git
cd youtube-sentiment
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the DVC pipeline

```bash
dvc repro
```

## Results

* Achieved **high accuracy & F1-score** with LightGBM
* Sentiment classes: **Positive | Negative | Neutral**
* Visualizations available in `eda.py`

---

## Future Improvements

* Incorporate deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers)
* Deploy as a web app (FastAPI / Streamlit)
* Extend to multilingual sentiment analysis
